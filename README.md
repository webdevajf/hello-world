# hello-world
My first GitHub repository! 
Hello world! My name is Alex. I've decided to make a career change from real estate to programing. I'm looking foreward to using GitHub to showcase my learning, my skills, and my projects. I'm starting my journy of learning with "Learn Python The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. I'll be making a repository for that project soon.
